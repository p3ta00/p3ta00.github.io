20 years in the United States Navy. Destroyers. Carriers. Deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. I've been in situations where the stakes were real long before I started breaking into boxes for a living.

These days, I lead a penetration testing team—and honestly, the best part of the job is working with hungry, talented people who remind me why I fell in love with this field in the first place. Watching the next generation of hackers level up? That never gets old.

## Philosophy

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Things I believe in:
"""

principles = [
    "The best hackers never stop being students",
    "Share knowledge freely—gatekeeping is for the weak",
    "Respect the craft, respect the community",
    "Mentorship isn't optional, it's a responsibility",
    "Break things to understand how they work",
]

for p in principles:
    print(f"[+] {p}")
```

## The Journey

From standing watch on a destroyer in hostile waters to standing up red team infrastructure—it's been one hell of a ride. The military taught me discipline, attention to detail, and how to operate under pressure. Offensive security gave me a new mission.

Now I get to combine both: leading operators, planning engagements, and occasionally still getting my hands dirty in the trenches.

20 years of service, still going strong
