## Welcome

This is my personal blog where I document my journey through CTF challenges, penetration testing labs, and security research.

## What to Expect

- **CTF Writeups**: Detailed walkthroughs of challenges from various platforms
- **HTB Machines**: Both active (protected) and retired machine writeups
- **Security Research**: Random findings and techniques
- **Tool Reviews**: My thoughts on various security tools

## Active Machine Policy

To prevent spoilers, writeups for active HackTheBox machines are protected. You'll need to enter the root flag hash to unlock them. This ensures only people who've already solved the box can read the writeup.

## Stay Connected

Feel free to reach out on GitHub if you have questions or want to discuss anything security-related.
